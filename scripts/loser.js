//A bead or token will eventually need to reach the end of the game. When the token wins the game, you are going to have a finale page where you will congratulate the user that has won. This page needs to be aesthetically pleasing. It would be nice if you could do some JavaScript animations on this page to make it interactive. Use your imagination here.
