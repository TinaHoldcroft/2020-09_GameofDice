//A bead or token will eventually need to reach the end of the game. When the token wins the game, you are going to have a finale page where you will congratulate the user that has won.

const playAgainButton = document.querySelector('#play-again-button');
playAgainButton.addEventListener('click', () => history.back()); //remember players and go back to game
